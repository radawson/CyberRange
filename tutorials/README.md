# Overview

The goal of this initiative is to help individuals get up & running quickly. 
Minimizing what you need to know & maximizing the time you spend learning a vast amount of content

CyberRange simply combines the best practices by using a CI/CD tool [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
  to continuously test every change sent into this project.
  
This tooling aims to provide a cloud-based learning platform for individuals
working in IT.  From Auditing to Operations to Cyber Security.  Across 
Vulnerability Mgmt, DevOps, Cloud Computing, Offensive Security, 
Quality Assurance, & Configuration Mgmt domains.  

This toolkit create a vulnerable enviroment from 10+ vulnerable virtual
machines, 3 of which are windows.  

You can break everything, destroy anything, and rebuild it all when you
want to start fresh and master a concept.

The deeper you go the more interest in customization
(e.g. install software, update licenses, download, etc).  Learn how to 
automate those tasks so you don't have to waste time repeating them.  

  
## Low-Cost
The goal is to make this project 'free tier' compatible, yet a truly setup research 
lab is going to require paid assets.

Destroy assets often. Terraform does a great job at creating assets, sometimes 
it's destruction is not perfect.  Consider learning how to wipe-out
your entire cloud account with `https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke`

This will help ensure a minimal bill & force you to learn how to use the basic AWS Cloud services.  

There are many training guides outlining the services, their purpose, and how-to connect things.

This project leverages [Terraform](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=aws+billing+alert) to automate the creation and 
linking of services & assets in the cloud.
